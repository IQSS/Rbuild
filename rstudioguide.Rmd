# Development with RStudio

The previous page in the guide was the [Introduction](./index.html). The next page in the guide discusses [GitHub](./github.html). This page will help you set up and install RStudio (we assume you are already somewhat familiar with R). If you already have RStudio installed and are comfortable using it, feel free to skip this section. Lastly, if you really don't want to use RStudio, we'll offer some alternatives in the first main section.
