# Introduction

If you want to skip the introduction, the next page in this guide is the guide to [RStudio](./development-with-rstudio.html). You might also want to look at the Table of Contents below. You can find the 'devex' example package linked [here, on GitHub](https://github.com/amspector100/packageguidelines/tree/master/devex). 

## What is a package?

Let's say you wrote a script like this in R and wanted to make it easy for others to use.

As you can probably tell, other users may not understand exactly what this script is supposed to do and how to use it. Even if they take the time to read through the source code and eventually figure it out, it might have been faster for them to just write the functions themselves. Packages solve this problem. Loosely speaking, *packages* are structured collections of code which aim to make your code easily sharable and reproducible. For example, any good package includes *documentation* which describes its functionality and use. Developing packages can be painstaking, but thankfully there are lots of tools today which make it extremely simple to create robust packages. This guide aims to run through how to use those tools and develop packages in R.

## Table of Contents

This guide is organized into two big parts. 

1. In the first part of this guide, we'll run through how to use two pieces of software  which make developing packages a lot easier. 
    a. First, we'll talk about [RStudio](./development-with-rstudio.html).
    b. Then we'll talk about [GitHub](./github.html).
2. In the second part of this guide, we'll run through:
    a. [The proper way to structure packages](./package-structure.html)
    b. and then [the proper way to test packages](./testing.html) during development. 
    
Lastly, we also wrote a small development example package (called 'devex') which you can find linked [here, on GitHub](https://github.com/amspector100/packageguidelines/tree/master/devex). If you haven't used GitHub yet, don't worry - we'll go over how to use GitHub before discussing package structure. 

Also, this guide is still under development, and we take feedback! If you find anything confusing or think the guide misses important contant, please email amspector100@gmail.com.

## What do I need to know before reading this guide?

Almost nothing! You don't need to know anything about Github, Rstudio, or package structure. However, this guide does assume you know how to do some programming in R. For example, if you want to develop a package which downloads and analyzes the content of politicians' tweets, this guide will help you structure your code, but it won't teach you how to scrape Twitter. 

## Sources

It's worth acknowledging a couple of people who helped make this guide possible.

1. A huge thanks to Simo Goshev at the IQSS, who helped design the structure of the guide and edited the content. 
2. Steve Worthington, Mercer, etc, people who gave comments.
3. This guide was written for a different audience, but a lot of its structure and content is based on Hadley Wickham's book [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/). A huge thanks to him as well.

### Github Sources:

We used [Karl Broma's Book](http://kbroman.org/GitHub_tutorial/pages/init.html), a [Git-Tower post](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/restore-repo-to-previous-revision
), and the GitHub documentation [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) and  [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) to help write this guide. 

### Packagedev sources:

A huge thank you again to Hadley Wickham and his book R Packages, linked [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html). 

### Testing sources:

We used the Testing chapter of [R Packages by Hadley Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html), [Christopher Gandrud's 'Failing Faster' Presentation](
http://slides.com/christophergandrud/failing-faster#/24), and [Christopher Gandrud's Broader Testing Guidelines](https://github.com/IQSS/social_science_software_toolkit/blob/master/testing/recommended_testing_tools_R.md#recommended-testing-tools-and-process-for-r-packages) to help write this particular page of the guide.
