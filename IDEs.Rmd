## RStudio


### Why use RStudio?

RStudio has two main advantages, which is why we recommend it for package development.

First, RStudio is generally built to make users' lives easier. It integrates documentation, makes graphics more accessible, and generally makes it easier to write scripts.

Second, RStudio has a suite of tools which make it easy to build well-documented, structured packages. Since this guide discusses package development, RStudio is the natural development environment. 
e). If you don't use RStudio, you'll probably want to look through these as you work through the guide. 

As a concrete example, RStudio also makes it a bit easier to initialize packages, which we'll see in a minute.

### Setting up RStudio

#### Setting up R

Presumably you've already been working with R, but you should make sure you have a recent enough version of R intalled. To do so, type "R.Version()" into the editor you've been working with previously. It should return an output titled "$version.string$", for example:
```{r}
R.Version()
```

If the number after the R version string is anything lower than 3.0.1, you'll have to install a new version of R in order to use R Studio. To do so, follow the steps below:

1. Go to https://cran.rstudio.com/ and select "Download R for [Your Operating System]." 

2. Click "base" and click "Download R [latest version] for [Your Operating System]" at the top of the page.

3. You can then let the installer run itself - the default settings should be fine for our purposes. 

Lastly, updating R on Windows can be a bit tricky. If you use Windows, you can also use the installr package to quickly update R, as documented [here](https://www.r-statistics.com/2015/06/a-step-by-step-screenshots-tutorial-for-upgrading-r-on-windows/). However, if you are having trouble installing the installr package, you can always just follow the instructions above. 


#### Setting up RStudio

To download and set up RStudio, follow the instructions below:

1. Head to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and click "download" for the free RStudio Desktop version

2. Download the *installer* for your operating system, not the *zip/tarball.* The picture below illustrates what the webpage should look like.

3. Let the installer run - it's fine again to just use the default options. 

and now you're ready!

### Basic RStudio Use

#### Screen Breakdown

RStudio will split your screen into four parts, as shown below. We'll refer to them as the *script*, the *environment*, the *shell* or *console*, and the *Viewer.*

![The RStudio Interface](./Images/rstudio2.PNG)


The *script* is in the upper left hand corner of the screen, and it's where you will do the bulk of your programming. To write an R script, click File>New File>R Script in the top left hand corner. You can execute multiple lines of a script (or the entire thing) at a time by selecting the lines you want to run and clicking the green "Run" button on the right hand side of the script box. 

The *shell* is in the lower left hand corner of the screen. Unlike scripts, which presumably you've worked with before, shells only run one line of code at a time. However, shells also remember what you did before. For example, if you define download some data into the shell, you can manipulate it repeatedly without having to download it again before each manipulation - it will stay in the shell's memory until you manually remove it.

All scripts that you run will be run through the shell - that is, if you run a script, all of the code from the script will appear in the shell. This means that you can run a script and manipulate the results directly from the bottom of the shell, without having to rerun the script each time you want to manipulate the results. You can also directly access the command prompt for your computer through the shell by clicking the "terminal" option.

Note that any errors caused by bugs in your code will show up in the shell. 

On the upper right hand corner of the screen, you can see the *environment* you're working in, which lists all the objects in the shell's "memory" or *namespace.* For example, if you download some data in a script and then run the script, the data will show up in the right hand corner of the screen.

On the bottom right hand side is the *Viewer.* Any plots you generate in R will automatically show up there. Additionally, as we'll discuss later, documentation of functions and packages will appear in the right hand corner. You can also use it to see the file structure of your working directory and the packages you're using by clicking "files" or "packages.""

#### Basic Commands

Presumably you're already familiar with R, but you should know a couple of commands specific to RStudio:

1. To remove an object from the environment, use the "rm" function as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(remove_this_object)

```

To remove all objects from the environment, you can use

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())

```

2. To see the documentation of any specific function, you can type

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?function_of_interest
```

In the example below, you'll find a picture of the documentation for the lm function, which is used for linear modeling. This is more convenient than having to open up a new browser window for each piece of documentation, as occurs with the R GUI.

3. To get RStudio to stop executing some code, you can press the red "stop" button in the top right of the console section. Sometimes this won't appear, so you can also just hit "escape" keyboard command instead.

4. To clear the console, hit Ctrl+L. 

5. To install packages, you can use the "install.packages('packagename')" command. For example, to install the mosaic package, you could run the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('mosaic')
```

A list of useful packages can be found [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/201057987-Quick-list-of-useful-R-packages). 

### Example: Initializing Packages

RStudio makes it easy to create packages. To start, click File>New Project. Then, click "New Directory" when you see the screen below:

![](Images/PackageSS/createproj1.PNG)

Then click "R Package" when you see the screen below:

![](Images/PackageSS/createproj2.PNG)

Lastly, name your package. Your name should be something short and descriptive. Since we'll be walking through a development example, we'll title our new package "devex."

![](Images/PackageSS/createproj3.PNG)

Once you've created your package, your RStudio should look something like this. It should come preloaded with a "Hello World" script which includes a handy function that prints "Hello world."

![](Images/PackageSS/projectinit.PNG)

Everything should look mostly the same as normal except for the "Files" tab on the bottom right, which should include an ".Rproj" file, a "DESCRIPTION" file, a "NAMESPACE" file, and a folder titled "R." You should start by checking the little boxes next to the "NAMESPACE" file and the "Hello.R" R script inside the R file and clicking "delete" above them, just because we will have Roxygen2 automatically generate the namespace, and because presumably your package doesn't need a "Hello World" function. 

You should also go to "Tools > Project Options" and select the following options, which will help you generate documentation using roxygen2:

### Example: Building Packages

Specifically, you should go to Build > Check Package. If you don't see any options under Build, you probably need to open your .Rproj file in the "file" section of RStudio (upon doing this, RStudio should restart briefly and then you will see more Build options).

Upon checking the package, RStudio will tell you if there are any warnings or errors raised by its automatic checking process. For example, it might tell you that a piece of documentation mismatches its complimentary function, or that the package needs an extra dependence. It's best to fix all of the problems RStudio points out, whether they are warnings or errors. 

Lastly, you can go to Build > Install and Restart, and then RStudio will build your package, restart, and load your package into R (using the library command). Then, you can use your package!
