### 0. To-do

## 1. Why should you test?

Suppose Grace has created a package and have been using it for a while, but she decides she'd like to modify one function to improve it. She modifies her function, tests it a bit, and then pushes her package to git. Yet two weeks later, Carlos discovers that the changes she made created a bug in *another* function in the package! This situation is very annoying, especially if Carlos has no idea what has caused the bug or how to fix it. 

The solution to problems like this is to testing your package *systematically* and *automatically*. If Grace had rigorously tested the entire package before pushing it to git, Carlos would never have had to deal with the new bug- Grace would have found out immediately. In other words, a good principle in package devleopment is to make sure your code *fails as fast as possible,* so you can find out and fix it. Of course, all programmers test their code, but not everyone tests systematically and automatically. 

In this guide, we'll broadly talk about three kinds of tests. First, we'll talk creating automatic *unit tests*, which are tests of individual blocks of code (usually individual functions or classes). Then, we'll talk about *integration tests*, which are tests of how individual blocks of code work in combination. Lastly, we'll talk about making your package *developer-proof* - i.e. if you have collaborators, or someone tries to fix your package, you can proactively prevent them from breaking anything important. 

## 2. Unit Tests

### 2.1: What are unit tests?

__ this answer is not really descriptive __

Tests in general compare the actual output of a block of code to its expected output. For example, the following test tests whether the "generalized square root" function actually returns $2$ as the square root of $4$.   

```{r, eval=FALSE}
expect_equal(general_sqrt(4), complex(real = 2, imaginary = 0))
```

*Unit tests* usually run automatically on the computer of the developer who is modifying a package - for example, if Grace is updating her package, unit tests on her updates will run on her computer. 

We'll talk a little more about how exactly to create tests down below, but hopefully this makes the general concept clear (you've also probably been using the general concept as you program). 

### 2.2: Setting up the testing environment

Creating unit tests is actually quite easy, thanks to a package called 'testtthat' which works in combination with devtools. To begin, you should make 'testthat' is installed by running the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('testthat')
```

Next, you'll want to make sure R recognizes you're working on a package (you can do this by navigating to the .Rproj file in the 'files' tab in the bottom right corner of RStudio and clicking on it). Then, you can run the following command in the console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::use_testthat()
```

This will do a couple of things. First, it will add 'testthat' to the Suggests part of the DESCRIPTION, which will help other collaborators know to use testthat when modifying/working on the package. It will also create a 'tests/testthat' directory in your project, as well a file called 'test/testthat.R', as shown below.

### 2.3: Expectations

Before understanding what a unit test is, we need to properly describe an expectation. An expectation tests whether the actual output of a single function call is what the developer expected. The 'testthat' package has a number of functions which compare outputs to expected values. When calling one of these functions, one of two things can happen:

1. If the actual output matches the expectation, nothing will happen!
2. If the actual output does not match the expectation, it will throw an error. 

For example, 'expect_equal()' uses the base R function 'all.equal()' to check whether an output is (approximately) equal to an expectation. In the following code, the first function call will do nothing - the second function call will throw an error, displayed below. 

```{r, eval = FALSE, error = TRUE}
library(testthat)
testthat::expect_equal(2, 2)
testthat::expect_equal(2, 4)
```
![](Images/TestSS/expectationerror.PNG)

Here's an (abbreviated) list of the expectation functions:

1. **expect_equal**, as aforementioned, checks equality using the "all.equal()" base function.
2. **expect_identical** checks equality using the "identical()" base function. Generally, it's better to use "expect_equal" because lots of R functions use numerical approximations which will cause expect_identical to fail when you don't want it to. 
3. **expect_match**, **expect_output**, **expect_message**, **expect_warning**, and **expect_error** all respectively test whether a string, output, warning, or error match a regular expression. For example, the following two expectations functions will not throw errors:

```{r}
testthat::expect_match('hello1234', 'hello')
testthat::expect_warning(sqrt(-2), 'NaNs produced')
```
respectively because 'hello1234' contains 'hello', and because the error message produced by sqrt(-2) contains the phrase 'NaNs produced'.

4. **expect_is** tests whether an object inherets from a class, specified in quotes. For example, the following test passes:

```{r}
testthat::expect_is(sqrt(2), 'numeric')
```

5. **expect_true** and **expect_false** respectively expect a statement to evaluate to true or false.

### 2.4: Structure of unit tests

Each *unit test* should use a couple of expectations to test a single core function. It should use the function "test_that" (from the "testthat" package). "test_that" takes two parameters: a string, which describes the test, and a couple of expectations, surrounded by curly braces. For example, the following code will test whether the general_sqrt function from the devex package returns a complex number. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
test_that("Returns complex number", {
  expect_is(general_sqrt(-2), 'complex')
  expect_is(general_sqrt(2), 'complex')
  expect_is(general_sqrt(0), 'complex')
})
```
